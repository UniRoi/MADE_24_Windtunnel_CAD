# MADE_24_Windtunnel_CAD

Every CAD object should only be changed by the creator to prevent conflicts.

Place each subsystem in seperate folders.
For example the loadcell files should be in a folder called load_cell, and the files for transfering the input motion should be in a folder called transfer_input or similar.
And so on.

Always pull before commiting and always add a commit message.
